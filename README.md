# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
---
#### Overview

 This repository contains the code for a Credit Card Fraud Detection project using a dataset from Kaggle, which includes  284,807 credit card transactions with only 492 frauds, is highly unbalanced. To address the class imbalance, the project implements a voting classifier and a neural network with focal loss in PyTorch, achieving an F1-score of 0.86 and 0.85 PR_AUC for the positive class (fraud).

python3 credit_fraud_train.py --config config.yml --trainer  trainer_config.yml
```        

**Note: install required packages as above first**

#### Results

Note:

- The optimal threshold calculated by finding highest F1-score and it's threshold **in training data only**.

#### Focal-loss 

Focal Loss is a specialized loss function designed to address the class imbalance problem commonly encountered in tasks like object detection. It was introduced in the paper "Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection." The main idea is to focus more on hard-to-classify examples while reducing the loss contribution from easy-to-classify examples. This is achieved through two parameter 𝛼 (alpha) and 𝛾 (gamma).

#### Focal-loss results 

* I tried Server combination of Alpha (0.80-0.99, +0.5) and gamma (0-4, +1).

* The best result archieve by Alpha 0.75 and gamma 2.

![best_alpha_gamma](docs/best_focal_loss.png)

* Notes:
  * Alpth and gamma sometimes unstables train using batchnorm make this effect less occur and switching from Adam to SGD also. 
  * High gamma (5~7) gives very noisey loss curve.

#### Smote and undersampling technique 

* SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is an oversampling method used to generate synthetic samples for the minority class. Despite experimenting with SMOTE, random over-sampling, and under-sampling techniques, the results on the validation data were poor.

* Smote (0.05-ratio) results:
