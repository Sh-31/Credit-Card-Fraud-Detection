\section{Data visualization using PCA}

As we can see from Figure~\ref{fig:PCA_2D} and Figure~\ref{fig:PCA_3D}, the dataset is highly imbalanced, with Class 0 dominating. There's no clear separation between most of the data points and a few outliers. \textbf{However, we cannot conclude any definitive information because this is just a projection in low dimension.}
